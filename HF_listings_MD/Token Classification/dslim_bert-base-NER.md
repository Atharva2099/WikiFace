## Architecture

Based on BERT's bidirectional transformer architecture, this model fine-tunes the bert-base-cased model (110M parameters) specifically for token classification. It uses deep bidirectional representations and maintains the original BERT architecture with an additional classification layer for NER tagging.

## Usage Guides

### Basic NER Inference
<p>How to perform basic named entity recognition using the Transformers pipeline</p>
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification
from transformers import pipeline

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dslim/bert-base-NER")
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("dslim/bert-base-NER")

nlp = pipeline("ner", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
example = "My name is Wolfgang and I live in Berlin"

ner_results = nlp(example)

## Model Limitations & Ethical Considerations

### Limitations
<p>The model is limited by its training dataset of entity-annotated news articles from a specific time period, which may not generalize well to all domains. It can occasionally tag subword tokens as entities, requiring post-processing for optimal results.</p>

### Ethical Considerations
<p>The model may reflect biases present in its training data, which consists primarily of news articles. Users should be aware of potential demographic and geographic biases in entity recognition.</p>

## Conceptual Summary

A fine-tuned BERT model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) that achieves state-of-the-art performance. Built on bert-base-cased and trained on the CoNLL-2003 NER dataset, it recognizes four entity types: Location (LOC), Organizations (ORG), Person (PER), and Miscellaneous (MISC).
