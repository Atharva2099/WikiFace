## Architecture

Based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, specifically the 'google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k' variant. Images are processed in 16x16 pixel patches and encoded as a sequence of tokens. The model uses a transformer encoder to learn relationships between these patches for classification. The architecture includes both a ViT implementation and a YOLOv9 quantized version for optimized inference.

## Usage Guides

### Basic Classification with Transformers Pipeline
<p>Simple approach using Hugging Face's pipeline abstraction for quick image classification</p>
```python
from PIL import Image
from transformers import pipeline

img = Image.open("<path_to_image_file>")
classifier = pipeline("image-classification", model="Falconsai/nsfw_image_detection")
classifier(img)
```
### Direct Model Usage
<p>Lower-level approach loading the model and processor directly for more control over the inference process</p>
```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification, ViTImageProcessor

img = Image.open("<path_to_image_file>")
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained("Falconsai/nsfw_image_detection")
processor = ViTImageProcessor.from_pretrained('Falconsai/nsfw_image_detection')
with torch.no_grad():
    inputs = processor(images=img, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    logits = outputs.logits

predicted_label = logits.argmax(-1).item()
model.config.id2label[predicted_label]
```

## Model Limitations & Ethical Considerations

### Limitations
<p>The model is specifically trained for binary classification of NSFW content and may not generalize well to other image classification tasks. Performance may vary depending on image quality and content type.</p>

### Ethical Considerations
<p>This model is intended for content moderation purposes and should be used responsibly in accordance with applicable regulations and content guidelines. Care should be taken to avoid bias in content filtering and respect privacy concerns.</p>

---

## Conceptual Summary

A Vision Transformer (ViT) model fine-tuned for NSFW image classification. The model uses a transformer encoder architecture adapted from BERT for image processing, pre-trained on ImageNet-21k and fine-tuned on a proprietary dataset of 80,000 images to classify content as either 'normal' or 'nsfw'. It achieves 98% accuracy on evaluation tasks.
