## Architecture

The model uses the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with base configuration (ViT-B/16), featuring 16x16 pixel patches and pretrained on ImageNet-21k. It has been fine-tuned specifically for age group classification with 9 output classes.

## Usage Guides

### Basic Age Classification
<p>How to perform age group classification on facial images using the model</p>
```python
from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, AutoModelForImageClassification
from PIL import Image

processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained('dima806/fairface_age_image_detection')
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained('dima806/fairface_age_image_detection')

image = Image.open('face.jpg')
inputs = processor(image, return_tensors='pt')
predictions = model(**inputs)
labels = ['0-2', '3-9', '10-19', '20-29', '30-39', '40-49', '50-59', '60-69', 'more than 70']
```

## Performance & Benchmarks

### Age Classification Performance
<p>Model performance across different age groups shows varying accuracy, with best performance in younger age groups (0-9 years) and declining accuracy in middle age ranges.</p>
| Age Group | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| 0-2 | 0.7803 | 0.7500 | 0.7649 | 180 |
| 3-9 | 0.7998 | 0.7998 | 0.7998 | 1249 |
| 10-19 | 0.5361 | 0.4236 | 0.4733 | 1086 |
| 20-29 | 0.6402 | 0.7221 | 0.6787 | 3026 |
| 30-39 | 0.4935 | 0.5083 | 0.5008 | 2099 |
| 40-49 | 0.4848 | 0.4386 | 0.4606 | 1238 |
| 50-59 | 0.5000 | 0.4814 | 0.4905 | 725 |
| 60-69 | 0.4497 | 0.4685 | 0.4589 | 286 |
| >70 | 0.6897 | 0.1802 | 0.2857 | 111 |

## Model Limitations & Ethical Considerations

### Limitations
<p>The model shows reduced accuracy for middle-age groups (30-59) and very elderly subjects (>70). Performance varies significantly across age groups, with best results for young children (0-9 years) and declining accuracy for older age ranges.</p>

### Ethical Considerations
<p>As a facial analysis model, care should be taken to ensure fair and unbiased application across different demographic groups. The model's varying accuracy across age groups should be considered when deploying in real-world applications.</p>

## Conceptual Summary

A Vision Transformer (ViT) model fine-tuned for age group classification from facial images, achieving approximately 59% accuracy across 9 age groups. The model is based on google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k and trained on the FairFace dataset to provide fair and balanced age predictions across different demographics.
